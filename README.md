# Inheritance-in-C-
## Aim
To study different types of Inheritance in C++.

## Theory
In C++, inheritance is a powerful feature that facilitates code reuse by allowing a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, forming a parent-child relationship. There are several types of inheritance: 

**Single inheritance** involves a derived class inheriting from a single base class, making it easier to extend functionality. 

**Multiple inheritance** enables a class to inherit from more than one base class, though it may lead to ambiguity issues, such as the diamond problem. 

**Multilevel inheritance** allows classes to inherit from other derived classes, forming a chain.

**Hierarchical inheritance** involves multiple derived classes sharing a single base class, offering common functionality to different subclasses. 

These inheritance forms support the object-oriented principles of reusability and extensibility, making C++ programs more modular and efficient.
